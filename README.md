# SquidGamesSentimentation

The squid game is currently one of the most trending shows on Netflix. It is so much trending that people who have never watched any web series before are also 
watching it. One of the reasons behind this is the reviews and opinions of viewers on social media.

The dataset that I am using for the task of Squid Game sentiment analysis is downloaded from Kaggle, 
which was initially collected from Twitter while people were actively sharing their opinionsabout Squid Game.
